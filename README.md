## Forks
Generate a random matrix of size 5 and bring it to the upper triangular form according to the Gauss method:
```
./fork-gauss 5
```
Generate a random array of size 10 and sort it using a combination of bubble sort and merge sort:
```
./fork-merge 10
```
Both programs use **shared memory**.

## Threads
Threads work exactly the same way using **pthread**:
```
./thread-gauss 4
./thread-merge 20
```
